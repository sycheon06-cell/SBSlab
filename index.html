                        <h3>Membrane-Based Dehumidification Systems</h3>
                        <p>Membrane-based dehumidification technologies represent one of our lab’s core research
                            directions, aiming to establish high-efficiency and non-refrigerant moisture control
                            solutions for future HVAC systems. As global humidity levels rise and latent loads become
                            increasingly dominant in buildings, traditional cooling-based dehumidification approaches
                            suffer from excessive energy use, deep overcooling, and reheat penalties. To overcome these
                            limitations, our research focuses on selective vapor transport across engineered membranes
                            that allow water vapor to permeate while blocking air and liquid water. We develop and
                            analyze several membrane-driven platforms, including vacuum membrane dehumidification (VMD),
                            cyclic membrane humidity pump systems, and membrane-enhanced DOAS configurations. These
                            systems leverage pressure or concentration gradients as driving forces, minimizing exergy
                            loss and eliminating the need for refrigerants. Beyond energy efficiency, membrane
                            dehumidifiers inherently improve hygienic performance by preventing air–water contact,
                            thereby reducing microbial transfer risks. Through experiments, theoretical modeling, and
                            system-level integration studies, we work toward scalable membrane-based humidity control
                            technologies that align with the demands of climate-adaptive and low-carbon buildings.</p>

                        <h3>Liquid Desiccant Air-Conditioning Systems</h3>
                        <p>Liquid desiccant (LD) technologies offer an alternative pathway for latent load management
                            using hygroscopic solutions that can absorb moisture efficiently at relatively low
                            temperatures. However, their practical implementation is challenged by solution heating,
                            thermodynamic inefficiencies, and sensitivity to operating conditions. Our lab conducts
                            comprehensive investigations into the heat and mass transfer characteristics of LD systems,
                            including ideal cycle analysis, packed-bed and membrane-type contactor design, and
                            regeneration strategies coupled with heat recovery. We develop experimental platforms that
                            allow for precise measurement of water vapor absorption, solution concentration changes, and
                            thermal performance. By clarifying the mechanisms that limit LD performance and by
                            optimizing flow configurations, heat exchange structures, and operating parameters, our
                            research aims to unlock the potential of LD systems as stable and high-performance
                            components of next-generation HVAC architectures. These advancements also provide strong
                            foundations for hybrid membrane–LD systems, further enhancing overall system flexibility and
                            energy efficiency.</p>

                        <h3>Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting Systems</h3>
                        <p>Building environments contain significant amounts of low-grade waste heat—distributed across
                            HVAC ducts, piping networks, facades, and indoor–outdoor surfaces—yet this energy is rarely
                            utilized. Our research on thermoelectric energy harvesting explores the conversion of small
                            temperature gradients into usable electrical power through solid-state thermoelectric
                            generators (TEGs). We design compact and durable TEG modules tailored to building
                            applications, incorporating airflow-assisted cooling, heat spreading structures, and
                            optimized thermal interfaces to enhance power output. These systems enable self-powered
                            operation of distributed sensors, environmental monitoring devices, and micro-scale
                            controllers, supporting the development of energy-autonomous building systems. By
                            characterizing the thermodynamic behavior of TEG devices in realistic HVAC and building
                            conditions, we aim to transform unused thermal losses into functional energy sources,
                            improving resilience, reducing wiring needs, and contributing to integrated smart-building
                            ecosystems.</p>

                        <p>Ensuring healthy and comfortable indoor environments is essential as buildings pursue deeper
                            energy savings and adapt to fluctuating climate conditions. Our lab evaluates indoor
                            environmental quality (IEQ) by integrating thermal comfort assessment, indoor air quality
                            (IAQ) measurement, and exposure-based risk evaluation for emerging HVAC technologies. We
                            analyze how temperature, humidity, airflow, contaminants, and building operation strategies
                            influence human comfort and well-being. In particular, we investigate the hygienic
                            performance of humidification and dehumidification systems by studying microbial transfer,
                            aerosol pathways, and air–water interaction risks. Membrane-based humidifiers and
                            dehumidifiers, which prevent direct contact between water and air streams, are examined for
                            their potential to eliminate cross-contamination issues and maintain safer indoor
                            conditions. Through quantitative comfort modeling, IAQ monitoring, and coupled HVAC–occupant
                            interaction studies, our research contributes evidence-based insights into how innovative
                            environmental control technologies can deliver both energy efficiency and enhanced indoor
                            health.</p>
